        "- **Components Used**: [`Agent`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/agent), [`OpenAIChatGenerator`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/openaichatgenerator), [`SerperDevWebSearch`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/serperdevwebsearch), [`ComponentTool`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/componenttool), [`SuperComponent`](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/supercomponents)\n",
        "- **Prerequisites**: You must have an [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and a [SerperDev API Key](https://serper.dev/api-key)\n",
        "- **Goal**: After completing this tutorial, you'll have learned how to create an Agent that can use tools both components and pipelines to answer questions and perform tasks."
